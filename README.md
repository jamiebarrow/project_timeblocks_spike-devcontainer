## Spike - devcontainers

This repository contains a spike to try out devcontainers in order to have a consistent and easy to use developer experience.

## Setup

I first did some preparation steps.

First, install Podman Desktop:

``` shell
winget install RedHat.Podman-Desktop
```

Second, the Microsoft Dev Containers extension is installed in VS Code (I've added it as a workspace recommendation).
